"ACS is our general purpose, commercial clustering strategy designed for "
"more or less typical XMPP installations of up to 5 - 7.5 millions of "
"online users and up to 50 cluster nodes. The load tests we have run over "
"the code were included a user database with 100mln accounts and an "
"average roster size of up to 150."

msgid ""
"The clustering strategy is based on sharing information between cluster "
"nodes about online users. Who is online and where the user is connected. "
"Communication between cluster nodes is processed with the highest "
"priority to ensure minimal delays with online user data population. An "
"efficient synchronization mechanism allows for a minimal traffic between "
"cluster nodes and distributing accurate data about connecting and "
"disconnecting users."
