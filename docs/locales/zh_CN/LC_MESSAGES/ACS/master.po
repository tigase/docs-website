"ACS is our general purpose, commercial clustering strategy designed for "
"more or less typical XMPP installations easily scaling to millions and "
"beyond of online users without limit on cluster nodes. The load tests we "
"have run over the code were included a user database with 100mln accounts"
" and an average roster size of up to 150, but that\\'s not the limit."

msgid ""
"The clustering strategy is based on sharing information between cluster "
"nodes about online users. Who is online and where the user is connected. "
"Communication between cluster nodes is processed with the highest "
"priority to ensure minimal delays with online user data population. An "
"efficient synchronization mechanism allows for a minimal traffic between "
"cluster nodes and distributing accurate data about connecting and "
"disconnecting users."
